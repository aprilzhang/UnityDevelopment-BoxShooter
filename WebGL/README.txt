Thanks for reviewing my work.

1. Note that you will need to use Firefox and Safari to load the game from index.html.
   (ref:Week 1 -Testing WebGL locally in a Browser)
2. When you start to play the game, there might be a popup saying "Would you like to allow the pointer to be hidden on this site?". 
   You will need to select "Hide pointer" in order to play the game smoothly.
3. Level2 has 20 seconds to play and it does not have a level beat score (so you can play util the time runs out). The change i made 
   in level2 is added Target-Bonus2 and Target-Negative2. I added one more target moving type in TargetMover script called "rotate around", 
   which is similiar to the rotate around method in our week2 project. The two new targets are using this new moving type.
4. The gameManager script has been changed in order to have the restart game function in level2.
